{"title":"Bobo Doll Experiment", "description":"During the early 1960s a great debate began regarding the ways in which genetics, environmental factors, and social learning shaped a childâ€™s development. This debate still lingers and is commonly referred to as the Nature vs. Nurture Debate. Albert Bandura conducted the Bobo Doll Experiment to prove that human behavior is largely based upon social imitation rather than inherited genetic factors.\r\n\r\nIn his groundbreaking study he separated participants into three groups: one was exposed to a video of an adult showing aggressive behavior towards a Bobo doll;  another was exposed to video of a passive adult playing with the Bobo doll;  and the third formed a control group. Children watched their assigned video and then were sent to a room with the same doll they had seen in the video (with the exception of those in the control group). What the researcher found was that children exposed to the aggressive model were more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior towards the doll themselves, while the other groups showed little imitative aggressive behavior. For those children exposed to the aggressive model, the number of derivative physical aggressions shown by the boys was 38.2 and 12.7 for the girls.", "initial_scene":"Start", "last_edit":"2019-10-15 18:23:13", "published":"false"}
